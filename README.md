## Docker Setup (Laravel Sail)

> If you're using Docker with Sail instead of a local PHP/MySQL setup:

1. Run `./vendor/bin/sail up -d` to start Laravel in Docker
2. Run migrations and seeder:
   - `./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed`
   - `./vendor/bin/sail artisan storage:link`
3. Visit the app at [http://localhost](http://localhost)
4. If port `80` or `3306` is already in use (e.g. by XAMPP), update your:
   - `.env`:
     ```
     APP_PORT=8080
     DB_PORT=3307
     DB_HOST=mysql
     DB_USERNAME=sail
     DB_PASSWORD=password
     ```
   - `docker-compose.yml`: change port mappings for app & MySQL
5. Stop XAMPPâ€™s Apache and MySQL services to avoid port conflicts

## Notes

- This is an **API-only** backend built with Laravel.

- **Postman collection** and **environment file** are included in the `postman/` folder at the root of this project.
